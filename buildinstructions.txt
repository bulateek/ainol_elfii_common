make -f kernel.mk TARGET=g06 INSTALL_ROOT=out/initramfs_<VERSION>/ CROSS_COMPILE=/<DIRECT_PATH_TO>/linaro_gnueabihf/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-

there's 3 initramfs inlcuded, choose which you want and build accordingly. 

eabi472 works better, the android_eabi in that folder works as well. 

so either 

make -f kernel.mk TARGET=g06 INSTALL_ROOT=out/initramfs_CM10/ CROSS_COMPILE=/media/ian/android1/AMLOGIC/ainol_elfii_common/toolchain/android-eabi_472/bin/arm-eabi- 

if you wish to flash this then do the following

adb push uImage_recovery sdcard/uImage_my_first_custom_kernel

then 
adb shell 
flash_image boot sdcard/uImage_my_first_custom_kernel
reboot 
if it all goes well then you'll need to fix the wifi with your own dhd.ko so

adb push .out/modules/dhd.ko sdcard/dhd.ko_mine
adb shell
cp /system/lib/modules/dhd.ko /system/lib/modules/dhd.ko.backup
cp /sdcard/dhd.ko_mine /system/lib/modules/



for the current builds on the Elf_ii you need newer Mali libs they are available here : 
https://github.com/fards/Elfii_mali_binaries

if you are using one of Christian Troy's builds then they are already included.
