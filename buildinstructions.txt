you need to use the toolchain listed, and change the path to the exact location. 

make -f kernel.mk TARGET=g06 INSTALL_ROOT=out/initramfs_<VERSION>/ CROSS_COMPILE=/<DIRECT_PATH_TO>/linaro_gnueabihf/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-

there's 3 initramfs inlcuded, choose which you want and build accordingly. 

so for example on mine. 

 make -f kernel.mk TARGET=g06 INSTALL_ROOT=out/initramfs_CM10/ CROSS_COMPILE=/media/ian/android1/AMLOGIC/ainol_elfii_common/toolchain/linaro_gnueabihf/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-

the android_eabi_ is still a work in progress
